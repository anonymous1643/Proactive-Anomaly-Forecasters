# Real-Time Proactive Anomaly Detection via Forward and Backward Forecast Modeling

Real-time anomaly detection is critical for preventing failures in high-stakes domains like industrial automation, financial systems, and satellite telemetry. Traditional anomaly detectors are reactiveâ€”they detect anomalies only after theyâ€™ve occurred. However, in many real-world applications, whatâ€™s needed is a proactive solution: one that can anticipate anomalies before they manifest.

This repository introduces two novel, real-time-capable frameworks for proactive anomaly detection:
- **FFM (Forward Forecasting Model):** predicts future values using historical context
- **BRM (Backward Reconstruction Model):** reconstructs past behavior using future context

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
    
### To run on MSL dataset:

```bash
bash demo.sh 
```

This repository only tests on the MSL dataset due to file size constraints. All other datasets are public on Kaggle.

## Datasets 

This repository uses four multivariate time series datasets, each curated for benchmarking anomaly detection models. The datasets span real-world spacecraft telemetry and server infrastructure data.
